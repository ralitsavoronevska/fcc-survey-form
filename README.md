Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey Form

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/VPaoNP. Do not copy this demo project.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

> You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

🔠 User Story #1: You should have a page title in an h1 element with an id of title.                                                                 
ℹ️ User Story #2: You should have a short explanation in a p element with an id of description.                                                      
🔡 User Story #3: You should have a form element with an id of survey-form.

✅ User Story #8: The number input should not accept non-numbers, either by preventing you from typing them or by showing an HTML5 validation error (depending on your browser).                                                                                                                         
❎ User Story #9: If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error.                                                                                                                                    
📝 User Story #10: For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label".

✏️ User Story #13: Inside the form element, you can select an option from a group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute.
✌️ User Story #14: Inside the form element, you can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.       
💬 User Story #15: Inside the form element, you are presented with a textarea for additional comments.                                                  
▶️ User Story #16: Inside the form element, you are presented with a button with id of submit to submit all the inputs.
